# OrderedLinkedList_CPP

### What this program does
Allows the flight manager to add people into one of four flights. These passengers will be stored in an ordered linked list in ascending order. The flight manager can then list, search, or delete passengers. 

### What you'll need to run this program
I used the IDE Clion, by jetbrains to run this code. Seeing as it is the source code the program should run fine in most IDE's. 

### What was this coded for
This was coded for Data Structure Assignment Two, the goal was to override a template linked list class with template ordered linked list.
